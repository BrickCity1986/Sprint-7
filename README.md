For this project, I worked with data from Instacart.

My mission was to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. 

I opened the data files (/datasets/instacart_orders.csv, /datasets/products.csv, /datasets/aisles.csv, /datasets/departments.csv, and /datasets/order_products.csv) and looked at the general contents of each table.

Preprocessed the data by doing the following by verify and fix data types (e.g. make sure ID columns are integers); Identified and filled in missing values; and identified and removed duplicate values.
